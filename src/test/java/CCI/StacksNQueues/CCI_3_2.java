* How would you design a stack which, in addition to push and pop,
* also has a function min which returns the minimum element?
* Push, pop and min should all operate in O(1) time.

/*
* Create an additional stack which keeps track of all the mins
* i.e. If the element to be pushed is less than the top of the min stack value, add it to the min stack
